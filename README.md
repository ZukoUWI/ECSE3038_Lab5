# THE Reason for it all
In this assignment, students will learn how to use Arduino to send HTTP requests to a server to report the states of three LEDs in their circuit to a webpage. 

Students should create an Arduino sketch that sends an HTTP request with a JSON body to an API to set the desired state of the light switches on a webpage.
